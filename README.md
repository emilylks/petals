# petals

Petals is an ios/android app which connects patients and healthcare providers like never before. 

The inspiration for Petals stemmed from the growing need for patient adherence assistance amid the pandemic, where uncertainty in routine health habits greatly impacts our most vulnerable populations. We wanted to create a healthcare specific communication application which congregates relevant and useful information while streamlining the communication channel between patients and their healthcare providers.

Our app promotes patient adherence and offers a unique opportunity for healthcare providers to provide quality care. It allows doctors and patients to communicate in a novel way, as the app allows healthcare providers to assign tasks (ex. Physiotherapy stretches) and patients to submit their proof of completion of each task. Additional functionalities are offered such as clinic locating, calendar scheduling and more.
